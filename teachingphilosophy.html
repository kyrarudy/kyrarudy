<h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

<p>I am drawn to a career in academia by a desire to influence scientific discovery and innovation through the instruction and mentorship of future engineers. My academic journey was profoundly shaped by exceptional educators who ignited my passion for learning and served as role models while I was forming my career goals. I aspire to emulate their invaluable influence by creating a dynamic learning environment that encourages critical thinking and communication while emphasizing empathy.</p>
<p>Numerous teaching experiences across multiple institutions have molded my approach to instruction. Through designing and delivering lectures, creating problem sets, grading assessments, and leading office hours, I have developed a keen understanding of the challenges students face and the strategies that can be employed to support their learning. I am particularly committed to providing clear, supportive, and actionable feedback to students. Moreover, I strive to foster a culture of open and honest communication to create a space where students feel empowered to ask questions and learn from their mistakes. Finally, an emphasis on empathy in engineering practice and in the learning environment is at the core of my teaching philosophy.</p>

<h2>Providing Bi-Directional, Actionable Feedback</h2>

<p>Effective communication is the cornerstone of successful learning. To foster a truly dynamic and interactive learning environment, it is essential to establish open lines of communication between students and instructors. By encouraging regular dialogue and feedback, I can create a space where students feel empowered to ask questions, seek clarification, and share their insights. I am committed to providing timely, specific, and actionable feedback that helps students improve their work. I am also committed to incorporating feedback from students into my instruction. By encouraging students to provide feedback on my teaching methods and materials, I can continuously refine my approach and ensure that it meets the evolving needs of my students.</p>

<h2>Promoting Open and Critical Discussion</h2>
<p>The classroom should be a space where diverse ideas are valued and challenged. By encouraging open and critical discussion, I aim to foster a learning environment where students can engage with complex ideas, develop critical thinking skills, and collaborate with peers. I use various strategies to promote active learning, such as class discussions, group work, and collaborative office hours. In my experience, encouraging students to discuss problems with their peers leads to a classroom community where differing perspectives can be shared to support a variety of learners.</p>
<p>Beyond technical proficiency, my teaching philosophy emphasizes the cultivation of a critical mindset. I believe that the ability to question assumptions and evaluate evidence is essential for solving complex engineering problems. By encouraging students to think critically, I aim to equip them with the tools to identify potential pitfalls, explore alternative solutions, and make informed decisions. To cultivate a strong problem-solving mindset, I encourage students to rely on both analytical reasoning and intuition. I encourage problem-solving approaches such as ‘sanity checks’ as a powerful tool for identifying errors early on and ensuring a feasible result. For instance, by considering the physical implications of a calculated value, one can avoid nonsensical solutions. This approach not only improves accuracy but also fosters a deeper understanding of the application of underlying principles to real-world scenarios. By promoting a questioning mindset, I aim to mentor engineers who can not only solve problems but also innovate and adapt to a rapidly changing world.</p>

<h2>Demonstrating and Teaching Empathy in Engineering</h2>
<p>The role of a professor extends beyond the teaching of the curriculum and into the mentorship of the young minds that will shape our future. In addition to mastering a challenging engineering curriculum, students need to learn how to empathize with their peers to effectively collaborate in the classroom and the workforce. However, they must also learn how to apply empathy in the context of engineering problems to better understand the perspectives and needs of intended users and stakeholders. It is therefore of utmost importance to demonstrate empathy as a teacher while also encouraging students to incorporate empathy into their problem-solving approach.</p>

<br>

<p>In summary, I am passionate about creating an academic environment where students feel challenged, supported, and inspired. By emphasizing critical thinking, fostering open dialogue, and providing actionable feedback, I strive to empower students to become innovative problem-solvers who are prepared to address the complex challenges of the future. Further, by fostering empathy and understanding, I will empower students to develop innovative solutions that truly address the needs of diverse populations.</p>
