<p><q>Dr. Rudy was a great instructor. She presented the content very well and was very helpful when questions were asked. Also she often went out of her way to go in depth into problems, with step by step instruction to aid our learning. Dr. Rudy was pivotal to my performance in this course.</q></p>

<p><q>Absolutely loved Dr. Rudy. She is probably one of my favorite professors I've had at Loyola, especially within the Engineering Department. She just made learning Systems so easy-- the way she was able to explain all the concepts was great; she's very smart but she's able to present the information in ways we will understand.</q></p>

<p><q>She is a very good teacher, and you can tell there is passion in her work!</q></p>

<p><q>Dr. Rudy was great. She was very approachable and always had an answer to our questions. She is definitely someone I would recommend to take if they are enrolling in a stats class.</q></p>
