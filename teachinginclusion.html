<h1>Teaching Diversity & Inclusion</h1>

<!-- <p>The role of an instructor extends beyond the teaching of curriculum and into the mentorship of the young minds that will shape our future. I believe that it is important to be an empathetic teacher while also encouraging students to incorporate empathy into their problem-solving approach.</p> -->

<p>As a first-generation college graduate and woman in STEM, I am deeply committed to fostering an inclusive and equitable learning environment for all students. I believe that higher education should be accessible to individuals from all backgrounds, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or disability. I am particularly passionate about promoting the inclusion of students with disabilities. As the daughter of an incredible woman who lives with a physical disability, I have firsthand experience with the challenges and barriers that individuals with disabilities face. I am determined to use my knowledge and life experiences to create a more inclusive and supportive academic community.</p>

<p>My former undergraduate research advisor has inspired me to work toward implementing a curriculum centered around empathy in engineering. I had the invaluable opportunity to work on rehabilitation engineering research as an undergraduate while mentoring junior researchers with physical disabilities. During this time, I quickly realized that all of the important problems that I wanted to solve using my engineering toolbox were ultimately human-centered. These human-centered problems require empathy to produce solutions that address the intended userâ€™s issues while conforming to their preferences. This is of utmost importance when tackling challenges in rehabilitation engineering, where the value of the solution is directly determined by the user who may have abilities and preferences that are in stark contrast to those of the engineer.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that by fostering empathy and understanding, we can empower students to develop innovative solutions that truly address the needs of diverse populations. I am excited to contribute to the creation of a more inclusive and equitable future for all through my instruction.</p>
